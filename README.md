# BitFS Final Speed Transfer Brute Forcer
A GPU-based brute forcing tool to search for working setups for the FST step of the BitFS 0xA TAS. This version of the brute forcer searches for slide-kick 10k PU routes. Full solutions are output into a CSV file (see -o in Options for more details).

This tool evolved out of Tyler Kehne's platform max tilt brute forcer, but has since come to encompass many other aspects of the FST setup.

## Options ##
This program accepts the following options:

#### Platform Normal Search Settings ####
<pre>
-nx &lt;min_nx&gt; &lt;max_nx&gt; &lt;n_samples&gt;:          Inclusive range of x normals to be considered, and the number of normals to sample.
                                              If min_nx==max_nx then n_samples will be set to 1.
  
-nxz &lt;min_nxz&gt; &lt;max_nxz&gt; &lt;n_samples&gt;:       Inclusive range of xz sums to be considered, and the number of z normals to sample.
                                              If min_nxz==max_nxz then n_samples will be set to 1.
                                              To search negative z normals, set to min_nxz and max_nxz to negative values.
  
-ny &lt;min_ny&gt; &lt;max_ny&gt; &lt;n_samples&gt;:          Inclusive range of y normals to be considered, and the number of normals to sample.
                                              If min_ny==max_ny then n_samples will be set to 1.

-nz:                                        Search by z normal instead of xz sum.
                                              Ranges supplied with -nxz will be converted to z normal ranges.
  
-q:                                         Search all 8 "quadrants" simultaneously. Overrides platform position set by -p.

## Dependencies ##
To maximise throughput, this program has been written in CUDA to allow for processing on the GPU. Therefore, to build this program you will need to install CUDA Toolkit (v11.7 or later is recommended).  

In addition, to run the program you will need a computer with CUDA compatible GPU. A GPU with compute capability 5.2 or higher and at least 4GB of RAM is recommended. Lower powered GPUs may still be able to run this program, but some tweaking of the build configuration may be necessary.

## Including this in your own projects ##
The brute forcer includes a basic API to run the program from external projects. The code snippet below shows an example of how this works:

```
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
#include "FST.hpp"
  
std::string outFile = "logFile.log"; // Path to log file
std::string outFile = "outData.csv"; // Path to solution csv file
std::ofstream wf; // Output stream for solution csv file
std::ofstream logf; // Output stream for log file
struct FSTData p; // Pointers to structures used by brute forcer
struct FSTOptions o; // Options for the brute forcer

// Open log file
// You can skip this if you don't want to output to a log file
logf.open(s.logFile);

// Set any options you want to change
o.nThreads = 128;

// Allocate memory and initialise the brute forcer structures
int error = initialise_fst_vars(&p, &o, logf);

// You may get errors if you don't have enough memory
// Check output variable for no errors
if (error == 0) {
    // Set up output csv file
    // You can skip this if you don't want to output them to a file
    initialise_solution_file_stream(wf, outFile, &o);

    // Pick a normal (or normals) you want to test
    float testNormal[3] = {0.1808f, 0.87768f, -0.396f};
  
    // Check if the normal has any solutions
    if (check_normal(testNormal, &o, &p, wf, logf).bestStage == STAGE_COMPLETE) {
          // Do stuff with successful normals
    }

    // When you're done, release the memory assigned to the brute forcer
    free_fst_vars(&p);
    wf.close();
    logf.close();
} else {
      // Report errors
}
```
